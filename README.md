# Genetic Logistic

Given a set of locations, find the best posible routes that passes through all of them. For this, **Genetic Algorithms** will be implemented.

# Flags

* --plot-locations: Plots the loaded locations and displays them.
* --debug: Set debug mode to True.

### Format

* .txt File inside the Routes folder with the name and direction of the street of a location.
* The first direction is the starting point.

# TODO

* [ ] Read all the information (locations, speed, etc) from a different file (example: txt, etc).
* [ ] Add more complex math to calculate the time for each phase.
* [ ] Add GUI.
* [ ] In case a file was loaded with locations, display the name of the locations.

# Dependencies
* GeoPy
* Numpy
